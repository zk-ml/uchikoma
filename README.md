uchikoma is a transpiler from TVM's intermediate representation to programming languages targeting emergent runtimes that do not support floating point operations. We currently support/plan to support:

 - [x] Circom for ZKP systems, which uses field arithmetic 
 - [ ] Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machines, which uses signed and unsigned integer arithmetic


The finalist submission for ETHSanFransico 2022 can be found under branch `ethsf-2022`.
